      Hi, <span style="color: rgb(255, 127, 127);">I'm Wan Hafizuddin</span>, a passionate web developer and tech enthusiast
      currently pursuing my studies at UPM. I am a Web App member in the GDGOC
      UPM department, where I contribute to web-related projects and collaborate
      with like-minded developers. Last semester, I had the opportunity to share
      my knowledge on the basics of CSS, which was a valuable learning
      experience. Since I'm still a beginner in web development, that session
      also introduced me to new concepts, like Tailwind CSS, which further
      expanded my skill set. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack web
      developer, mastering both front-end and back-end technologies. I’m also
      eager to explore mobile app development, as I believe building
      cross-platform applications will expand my ability to create seamless
      digital experiences. I also love running and listening to music—both help
      me stay focused and motivated. This year, my biggest goal is to achieve a
      sub-2-hour half marathon, pushing my limits and improving my endurance.
      When I’m not coding or training, you’ll likely find me exploring new tech
      trends, working on personal projects, or discovering fresh music
      playlists.
